When a deer was 48m from a leopard, the leopard starts chasing the deer and the deer immediately starts running away from the leopard with constant velocity. A leopard cannot run at high speeds for a longtime and has to slow down due to fatigue. If we assume that the leopard starts with an initial speed of 30m/s and reduces its speed with acceleration -5m/s^2, at what minimum speed must the deer run to escape from the leopard?
