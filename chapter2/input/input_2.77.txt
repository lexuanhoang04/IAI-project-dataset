Two stones are thrown vertically upward from the ground, one with three times the initial speed of the other. 
(a) If the faster stone takes 10 s to return to the ground, how long will it take the slower stone to return?
(b) If the slower stone reaches a maximum height of 30m, how high  will the faster stone go? Assume free fall.
