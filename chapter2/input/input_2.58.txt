A block moving on a horizontal surface is at x = 0 when t = 0 and is sliding east with a speed of 12.0 m/s. Because of a net force acting on the block, it has a constant acceleration with direction west and magnitude 2.00 m/s2. The block travels east, slows down, reverses direction, and then travels west with increasing speed.
(a) At what value of t is the block again at x = 0?
(b) What is the maximum distance east of x = 0 that the rock reaches, and how long does it take the rock to reach this point?
